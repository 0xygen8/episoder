In order to use episoder, you will need python installed on your system. In
addition to the default distribution, the 'beautifulsoup', 'yaml', 'sqlite2'
and 'sqlalchemy' modules are required. On debian systems the corresponding
packages are called python-beautifulsoup, python-yaml, python-pysqlite2 and
python-sqlalchemy.


== Configuration ==

See "man episoder"


== Installation ==

  * Run 'python setup.py install'
  * Create a cron job to have your database rebuilt once a day
  * Add "episoder" to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, /etc/bash.bashrc or /etc/profile if you want to see your upcoming shows every time you start a shell. Consult the bash docs to find out which file you want to use.
