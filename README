INSTALLATION (TODO: UPDATE)
------------

	* Create a cron job to have your database rebuilt once a day
	* Add "episoder" to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, /etc/bash.bashrc
	  or /etc/profile if you want to see your upcoming shows every time
	  you start a shell. Consult the bash docs to find out which file you
	  want to use.
