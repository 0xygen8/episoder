== Purpose ==

episoder is a tool to tell you about new episodes of your favourite TV shows.


== Dependencies ==

In order to use episoder, you will need python installed on your system. In
addition to the default distribution, the 'beautifulsoup', 'yaml', 'sqlite2'
'sqlalchemy' and 'tvdb_api' modules are required. On Debian systems the
corresponding packages are called python-beautifulsoup, python-yaml,
python-pysqlite2, python-sqlalchemy and python-tvdb-api.


== Installation ==

* Run 'python setup.py install'
* Create a cron job to have your database rebuilt once a day
* Add "episoder" to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, /etc/bash.bashrc or /etc/profile if you want to see your upcoming shows every time you start a shell. Consult the bash docs to find out which file you want to use.


== Configuration ==

See "man episoder"
